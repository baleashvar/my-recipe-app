Recipe Application
--------------------------
 You can refer to this Youtube link for Creating Reactjs Project-https://youtu.be/av5fmpgEJSU
 
Steps:
1. Set up your development environment. Install Node.js and create a new React project using
create-react-app.
2. Create a new component called RecipeList. This component will render a list of recipes.
3. Create a state variable called recipes, which will store an array of recipe objects. Initialize
this array with some sample data.
4. Loop through the recipes array and render a Recipe component for each item. Each Recipe
component should display the name, image, and description of the recipe.
5. Add a form to the Recipe List component that allows the user to filter the list of recipes
based on specific criteria such as meal type or dietary restrictions. Use a select element and
options to allow the user to select the criteria.
6. Use the use State hook to manage the selected criteria state.
7. Filter the recipes array based on the selected criteria and render the filtered list of recipes.
8. Add a search bar to the Recipe List component that allows the user to search for recipes by
keyword. Use the state hook to manage the search keyword state.
9. Filter the recipes array based on the search keyword and render the filtered list of recipes.
10. Add some basic stylings to your application using CSS.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
